Parkspace - an application to manage parking garages. From monitoring your own parking garage to facility management and detailed analyses of events in the parking garage, everything is possible for the parking garage manager. But not only for the owner of the garage this application brings advantages, but also for the end user, who can get an overview of the parking garages, see the current status of the garage via Occupancy Signs and get a better parking experience.

## System Architecture

The system's architecture is split into Frontend and Backend, consisting of several microservices.
Also part of the backend is a NoSQL database, hosted by Google Cloud Firestore.
